Understanding the Chatbot's Workflow
Data Integration and Extraction
Data Source: The chatbot utilizes a PDF book as its primary source of medical information. This book contains details about various diseases, their symptoms, treatments, and other relevant medical data.
Extraction: The content from the PDF book is extracted and converted into a textual format that the chatbot can process. This involves extracting text from the PDF, handling formatting, and ensuring the extracted data is in a suitable format for subsequent steps.
Text Chunking
Reasoning: The language model used in the chatbot has limitations on the input size it can process at once. To address this, the extracted text is divided into smaller, manageable chunks.
Process: The text is broken down into segments of a predetermined size. This ensures that the model can process each chunk efficiently and avoid overwhelming it with excessive information.
Embedding Generation
Purpose: Embeddings are numerical representations of text that capture the semantic meaning of the words and phrases. They are essential for the chatbot to understand and process the information effectively.
Process: Each chunk of text is converted into an embedding using a suitable embedding technique. This involves transforming the text into a numerical vector that represents its semantic meaning.
Semantic Index Creation
Purpose: The semantic index is a database that organizes the embeddings in a structured manner. It helps the chatbot quickly find relevant information based on user queries.
Process: The embeddings generated from the text chunks are stored in the semantic index. The index uses algorithms to calculate the similarity between different embeddings, allowing the chatbot to efficiently retrieve related information.
Knowledge Base
Purpose: The knowledge base is essentially the repository of medical knowledge that the chatbot can access. It is built using the semantic index.
Structure: The semantic index organizes the embeddings in a way that allows the chatbot to easily search for and retrieve information based on specific queries.
User Interaction and Response Generation
User Query: A user asks a question related to medical topics.
Query Processing: The chatbot processes the user's query and converts it into an embedding. This embedding represents the semantic meaning of the query.
Information Retrieval: The chatbot searches the semantic index for embeddings that are similar to the query embedding. This helps identify the most relevant information from the knowledge base.
Response Generation: Based on the retrieved information, the chatbot generates a response using the language model. The model processes the information and formulates a coherent and informative answer to the user's query.
Technologies
Python: A popular programming language used for building the chatbot's logic and functionality.
Langchain: A framework that simplifies the process of building and deploying language models.
Flask: A web framework used to create the chatbot's user interface.
Meta Llama 2: A powerful language model capable of understanding and generating human-like text.
PineCone: A vector database that efficiently stores and retrieves embeddings.
